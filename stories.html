							<h3></h3>
							<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/people/Jay1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p>My name is Jay Narayana, and I am from the Begusarai district in Bihar. I come from a farming background; my father is a teacher by occupation but does farming out of interest. I also liked farming, and in my childhood days, I went to the fields with my father. I enjoyed sports and played lots of them till high school. In my 11th standard, I decided to focus on my studies. Although I was good in academics, I had little idea about IITs and JEE and was not that interested. I used to go to a regular coaching center for my studies. One day, I saw an advertisement<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">  that some famous coaching institutes for JEE preparations that provided free teaching, food, and lodging, were conducting scholarship tests. I decided to give it a shot and started preparing for them. I came 5th out of 3200 aspiring students and was also selected for Anand Kumar Sir's famous Super 30 batch. This was a major motivation for me to start preparing for JEE. From here, I began my preparations. After two years of extensive coaching, uncountable exams and mocks, and endless sacrifices, I made it to IIT Jammu as an Electrical Engineering undergraduate.

When I joined college, it was a different world altogether. We were completely free and could live life by our rules. In my first year of engineering, I enjoyed this new unrestricted environment - the college life, activities, and everything happening in my life to the fullest. The academics weren't that burdensome, and the fun was unlimited. As I progressed in my course, every night, I would contemplate my day's routine, activities, and honestly speaking, I found myself in dissatisfaction. When I went home for summer vacations, I tried doing a lot of different things. I was trying to understand my purpose, what I was made for, and what kind of work I enjoyed doing. Coming from Bihar, my parents also had the same dream every parent has - to clear the UPSC exams and secure a good government administrative position. The professors in my college were also study-oriented and focussed primarily on academics. However, I was very average performing in college, getting 6-7 pointers in each semester.
In my third semester, I came in contact with one of the project engineers at IIT Jammu, Pranjal Sir, who introduced me to the concept of entrepreneurship and motivated me to explore it. I also liked the idea and started exploring this amazing field. For one year, I was studying only entrepreneurship. This even affected my grades in those semesters, but all of it seemed worth the sacrifice. During this period, I was the coordinator of the Arts Club in college. There were some meetings regarding the institute logo with Director sir. On 13th April 2018 (the date is still in my head), I pitched a faint idea of a cafe that I wanted to open to him. I was in my 4th semester at that time. His initial response was that I should talk to the students and people on the campus and find out what was actually wanted - what the current facilities were unable to provide? I brainstormed for a long time with my friends and some juniors on this topic - the canteen facility in our college, the food delivery system and everything in between. I also started working on some other ideas parallelly along with this one.
During this time, there was a seminar on entrepreneurship conducted in our college by Team Startup India. Along with two of my juniors - Vishwas and Tushar, I was working on an idea related to farming during that time. We decided to pitch the concept when they talk opened for questions and ideas. Our idea was to remove any third-party involvement between the farmer and consumer via supply chain optimization, middlemen cost-cutting, and intelligent use of technology. We laid out a clear-cut strategy to provide a higher than the current selling price to the farmer and lower than the current cost price to the consumer. The panel liked our idea and considered us for a national event they were conducting. After this, there was a telephonic interview round, in which we qualified and got selected for the finals in October 2018. We bagged the 3rd position among 580 teams in the finals for our idea - which was an unbelievable achievement. This served as a motivation booster for us - we got results much better than we had ever expected. Also, we got incubation offers from 2 government-funded farming industries. We have been working on the idea and are gaining more and more insight in this vast field of farming and agriculture, which constitutes about 40% of our GDP.
My experience with opening a full-fledged cafe in our college has also been full of ups and downs. I had to make uncountable visits to our college's office and admin department. There were numerous committees formed, including people from all departments of IIT Jammu, and I had to bring all of them on the same page. I can loosely say that in some sense, I had to convince the entire college that my idea was feasible and worth a chance. This was a very tough and non-rewarding period. After many failed attempts, inconclusive meetings, and conflicting opinions, came a day that changed everything.
When the country had gone in Lockdown, and there was a scarcity of food services in our college, my proposal got accepted. I had been going to the admin department for a long time now. It was a regular Sunday afternoon, and after some final discussions, I was given the official permission to set things up. I promised to set up the cafe in 2 weeks. We had to bring in everything, from supplies to the seating arrangements, decorations, and everything necessary, in just 14 days, so we started that very evening. From a space near the admin department that was of no use to a fully functional cafe - we did it all in just 14 days and 14 sleepless nights. I have named the cafe, Cafe 4teeN's - "Apna Adda." It was inaugurated on 14th September 2020 by one of the founding members of IIT Jammu - Pandya Sir, and we have not stopped working a single day since then. It has been a great experience, and we're still improving and getting used to the hardships and struggles. After judging our quality of service, we even got an offer from Director sir to open a subsidiary outlet in the Paloura campus, which I accepted as soon as I heard it!
    It has been a roller coaster ride since Cafe 4teeN's has started. Currently, the only dream I have for our cafe is to improve our reach. We want to target other educational institutions - schools, universities, markets with the same spirit and provide quality service to our customers. Profit is not a priority since this is the time to establish our business and build our brand, which will require a lot of rough days and nights. The days when we can sit back and relax are yet to come, but we are working hard for it. I am working with the motto that all our dreams can come true if we dare to pursue them.

							<h3></h3>
							<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/people/Vishwas1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p>My name is Vishwas Kushwaha, and I'm a 3rd-year mechanical engineering undergraduate.
								This is my story of how I realized
								my interest in tennis and worked my way to win 6 national tournaments.

								Initially, I was not a huge fan of tennis, never really knew much about it. When I got
								shifted to the Railway Colony in
								Allahabad, there were three tennis courts just beside the badminton hall there. I had
								never seen tennis being played in
								person, so I went to check out what it was? And that was my first encounter with the
								sport. I saw children my age (I was
								15 at that time) <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">doing rallies with the coach,
									and it looked pretty astonishing. That's
									when I told myself I need to
									play this. So the next day there I was there, standing on the court with my Dixon
									tennis
									racket. My coach asked me if I
									had any experience in tennis, to which I replied no. He put in the second batch,
									which
									was for beginners. So I trained
									there for two months, from learning how to hold a racket to knowing the rules,
									techniques, and icons of tennis (BTW, I'm
									a huge Roger Fan). After these two months of induction, I got promoted to the first
									batch where the best players
									(players who wanted to pursue tennis as a career) used to play. My coach made me
									play
									with 2 of them who were younger
									than me. I thought it would be super easy but got crushed 6-0 by both of them. My
									coach
									told me post-match that I need
									to reach their fitness level and precision if I ever wanted to defeat them. From
									here,
									started the actual work.
									I started training every day of the week from 4-6 PM.
									It started with running 30 minutes non-stop, then line touching and sprints,
									standard in
									all sports. There were many
									other drills distributed all over the week, which we had to complete before touching
									our
									rackets. We used to have
									practice matches on weekends, but before that, we had to run ten rounds of the
									cricket
									stadium (approx 6-7 km) with 2 kg
									weights on each ankle. Seniors had to play matches with 0.5 kg wrist weights on. The
									coach did this to prepare us for
									the mental fight we had to face when playing long games in harsh conditions. And it
									did
									pay off.

									My first national tournament was at La Martiniere College, Lucknow, when I was 16,
									and I
									was playing in the under 18
									singles and doubles category. I lost in the quarter-finals of singles but won the
									doubles with my partner Aman Kumar,
									currently ranked 24th in India. I was quite happy with my result, but my coach was
									not.
									He increased the intensity of
									drills for everyone. Two months after that, I played my 2nd open national tournament
									in
									Indore and won my first national
									trophy and prize money. Big moment for me. I used this money to buy shoes and
									rackets
									because, in tennis, the racket is
									your sword and shoes, your armor (although I wanted to buy some fancy rackets and
									shoes
									to show off, I was too young for
									this racket-sword philosophy).
									After this, I played many tournaments, of which I won some and lost many, but it was
									an
									amazing experience. I stopped
									playing tennis after my 10th boards and switched to badminton because I needed the
									energy to study, which was usually
									gone after my tennis practice. After joining college, I play tennis occasionally,
									whenever I'm home with my friends. I
									don't have the same level of game I used to have, but I'm good enough to hit the
									ball on
									the opposite side of the court
									somehow.</span></p>

								<h3></h3>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/people/Jishnu1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>My name is Jishnu Gera, and I am a 2nd year undergraduate in the Computer Science and Engineering department. This is my story about my interaction with Table Tennis. I was in 2nd class when I first came to know what table tennis was all about. I used to accompany my Father for Badminton at that time; my brother allowed me to play only one point at the table (with a 25 Rs racket of JJ). I was unknown to the fact that my school did have a table where students gathered and played.<span id="dots3"></span><span id="more3"> The only way I could afford extra time to play was to bunk the prayer session, which I managed. I don't recall the time I spent in wall practice, but the only thing I remember is that we only played on the table only when our seniors were not playing. They were our only coaches, teaching us the things they knew. So, it was mostly like shooting arrows in the dark, where we were at a table doing anything we wanted and learning by watching our seniors play.
									Everything started coming in line when I was selected for the Under 14 team in 6th standard and given a TT table to practice. We participated in various tournaments that year representing our school. It was in 8th class when I first got to play district finals. Winning Quarters from Kaithal, Semi's from Sirsa, we had a match with Patiala. Our team lost the first match; then I played the second match with a 2-0 (up) set score. But we lost 2-3 from "Madhav" (a name still in my head). Team Set Score 0-2 (down). Now, we had to win all the three remaining matches to win the title.
									My teammates Rajat and Gautam devised a strategy; Rajat said, "Main third nikaal ke aaunga.. Gautam 4th nikaalega.. Tujhe last nikaalna hai!" That spirit and the mamba strategy helped me gain confidence, and I made up my mind to ace the last match. We were all set to put up the best show we could. And guess what? We won.
									Our team was selected for the NATIONALS to be held in Kolkata. But you know, life is still unfair. Even after all the hardships and getting selected, we were unable to participate in Nationals. It was a very depressing day when our teacher-in-charge informed us that our tickets were not confirmed and we could not proceed further. We were already late and couldn't arrange any other mode of transport too. It was that day that our spirits were broken, and all the energy, gone. One of my teammate's grandfather restricted playing TT and took away this racket. Others also stopped practice sessions and started focussing on academics. Our journies had taken a different turn. My father stopped intriguing me about the game and demotivated me from playing further. I still remember the days when I practiced alone on the table, did the service, picked the ball from the other side, again did the service from the other end - and so on. This went on for a considerably long time.
									In the 11th standard, we got a chance to go to Patiala for another cluster. We clashed with the same team as before, just this time they were in quarters, then in the finals. A similar thing happened again. I lost the first game, Gautam lost the 2nd game. If we lost the third, we would have been just another team participating in the tournament. But a similar thing happened in this clash also. Rajat won the 3rd set single-sided. The 4th match was mine against "Madhav," which I managed to win. Now everything was on the decider set(5th Set). A single loss and we would be out of the league. I still remember the score. 
									I was 10-6 down.
									Everyone lost hope. 
									Only one point to lose and we were out! 
									The score becomes 10-8. Madhav to serve. 
									I don't know where the confidence came from, But I smashed the chop serve that came on a deep forehand. Got the point. 
									10-9. 
									I wasn't keeping track of the points, but I still remember the crazy dance I did when the referee shouted "DEUCE!" All the matches from the other two tables stopped for 10 mins. Only the middle one had an ongoing game with 10-10. 
									The last two points were the best. Though we lost to Patiala, this is the best match I played to date!
									After that, I started pursuing my 12th from Kota. This is another story of how I landed in Kota and why I started preparing for JEE. Some of you may know, and If you don't and are interested, let's do "chai pe charcha" someday. After getting admission to IIT Jammu, I was quite happy that the institute provided the best facilities related to table tennis to pursue my passion. I participated in the Inter-IIT Sports Meet, which was a fantastic experience. We won from IIT Jodhpur and Goa but lost from IIT Bombay and Gandhinagar. I know that a pandemic has struck us, but I hope that the situation will soon be normal, and I will play for my college once more in my B.Tech years!
