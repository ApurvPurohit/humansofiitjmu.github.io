							<h3></h3>

							<p>My name is Vishwas Kushwaha, and I'm a 3rd-year mechanical engineering undergraduate.
								This is my story of how I realized
								my interest in tennis and worked my way to win 6 national tournaments.

								Initially, I was not a huge fan of tennis, never really knew much about it. When I got
								shifted to the Railway Colony in
								Allahabad, there were three tennis courts just beside the badminton hall there. I had
								never seen tennis being played in
								person, so I went to check out what it was? And that was my first encounter with the
								sport. I saw children my age (I was
								15 at that time) <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">doing rallies with the coach,
									and it looked pretty astonishing. That's
									when I told myself I need to
									play this. So the next day there I was there, standing on the court with my Dixon
									tennis
									racket. My coach asked me if I
									had any experience in tennis, to which I replied no. He put in the second batch,
									which
									was for beginners. So I trained
									there for two months, from learning how to hold a racket to knowing the rules,
									techniques, and icons of tennis (BTW, I'm
									a huge Roger Fan). After these two months of induction, I got promoted to the first
									batch where the best players
									(players who wanted to pursue tennis as a career) used to play. My coach made me
									play
									with 2 of them who were younger
									than me. I thought it would be super easy but got crushed 6-0 by both of them. My
									coach
									told me post-match that I need
									to reach their fitness level and precision if I ever wanted to defeat them. From
									here,
									started the actual work.
									I started training every day of the week from 4-6 PM.
									It started with running 30 minutes non-stop, then line touching and sprints,
									standard in
									all sports. There were many
									other drills distributed all over the week, which we had to complete before touching
									our
									rackets. We used to have
									practice matches on weekends, but before that, we had to run ten rounds of the
									cricket
									stadium (approx 6-7 km) with 2 kg
									weights on each ankle. Seniors had to play matches with 0.5 kg wrist weights on. The
									coach did this to prepare us for
									the mental fight we had to face when playing long games in harsh conditions. And it
									did
									pay off.

									My first national tournament was at La Martiniere College, Lucknow, when I was 16,
									and I
									was playing in the under 18
									singles and doubles category. I lost in the quarter-finals of singles but won the
									doubles with my partner Aman Kumar,
									currently ranked 24th in India. I was quite happy with my result, but my coach was
									not.
									He increased the intensity of
									drills for everyone. Two months after that, I played my 2nd open national tournament
									in
									Indore and won my first national
									trophy and prize money. Big moment for me. I used this money to buy shoes and
									rackets
									because, in tennis, the racket is
									your sword and shoes, your armor (although I wanted to buy some fancy rackets and
									shoes
									to show off, I was too young for
									this racket-sword philosophy).
									After this, I played many tournaments, of which I won some and lost many, but it was
									an
									amazing experience. I stopped
									playing tennis after my 10th boards and switched to badminton because I needed the
									energy to study, which was usually
									gone after my tennis practice. After joining college, I play tennis occasionally,
									whenever I'm home with my friends. I
									don't have the same level of game I used to have, but I'm good enough to hit the
									ball on
									the opposite side of the court
									somehow.</span></p>
